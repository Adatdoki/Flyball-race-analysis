Analysis of the 2023 Flyball Competition Results

During the competition, we will simulate that a fictional Flyball team (Wild Runners Flyball Team – hereafter referred to as WRFT) has approached the Data Science Club to find the most qualified analyst to help process the team's 2023 competition results. The goal is to use the analyses to enable the team to achieve even better performance in the future.

*Flyball is a relay team sport for dogs where participants jump over hurdles to retrieve a ball from a special box.
