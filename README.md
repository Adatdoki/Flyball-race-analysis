Analysis of the 2023 Flyball Competition Results

During the competition, we will simulate that a fictional Flyball team (Wild Runners Flyball Team – hereafter referred to as WRFT) has approached the Data Science Club to find the most qualified analyst to help process the team's 2023 competition results. The goal is to use the analyses to enable the team to achieve even better performance in the future.

*Flyball is a relay team sport for dogs where participants jump over hurdles to retrieve a ball from a special box.

The code generated is intentionally not cleaned. I have left in the experiments, unfinished parts, and sections that need to be finalized or simplified. The reason for this is that for me, the project did not end with the competition. The competition was almost just an excuse to take the project more seriously. But the main motivation was learning, i.e., Python coding, problem-solving, analysis, and practicing with real-life data. Understanding and cleaning the data could have been done more easily using Excel, which I already know and use well, but the goal was to accomplish the project entirely with Python code from start to finish. I wanted to experiment with possibilities, try out reusable functions, built-in automations, and different data cleaning methods for data analysis. Meanwhile, I have built a repository of functions and solutions that can be used later.
